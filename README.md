  ## Description 
  
  This project is supposed to be a display of using the ORM, controller, and model files to move information to and from the front end.  It is supposed to allow user input of a food item, and have that food be on either a consumed or not consumed list, with buttons that would allow the user to move the food item to the other list.

I struggled quite a bit with this project and did not finish to my satisfaction.  While my get function worked, and at one point my create function worked, I could not get my update function or delete functions to work. I could not get my input area centered on the page, and could not get the image to be in the background.

I WILL figure it all out over the weekend, but I am very frustrated with my own lack of ability to finish this app in time for the due date.  I hope consideration will be given if I get it running and update my files later. Thank you.
