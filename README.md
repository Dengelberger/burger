  ## Installation 
  
  The user needs to use the Heroku link to deploy the app on a web page.  Just a note...the Delete keys have an issue of not taking effect until the page is refreshed at the top or by clicking on one of the other types of buttons.  This issue is in the process of being resolved.

  ## Usage 
  
  The user can deploy the page from the Heroku app or through the Heroku link when given.  The user can type in any burger name they wish and click the "Add burger" button, and that burger will be added to the left side of the page.  The user can click on any "Eat It" button and that burger will be moved to the right side of the page.  The user can click on any "Delete It" button and that burger will disappear (on refresh or reload of the page, for now).
